Task 2 - EDA

Using this dataset, you are supposed to prepare an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report
in PDF format that shows at least 3 different insights about this data (number of examples
per class, top frequent n-grams generally and per class, lengths of examples in words and
letters, ….) . Feel free to show your insights in a good format (description, tables, charts,
…).

Note that you can prepare the PDF manually after generating the analytics in any other
format (CSV, xls, doc), …).
Note: Use stories data only (not comments).
